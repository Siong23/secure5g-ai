# 5G Network Anomaly Dataset for Intrusion Detection

This README.md contains dataset of network traffic from a real 5G test lab environment, designed for developing and testing anomaly and intrusion detection systems. The dataset includes both `benign` traffic and `malicious` traffic from **flooding** , **fuzzing** and **Denial-of-service (DoS)** attacks.

## <br>üìù Overview

The security of 5G networks is critical, yet there is a scarcity of public datasets capturing realistic attack scenarios in this new architecture. This project aims to bridge that gap by providing a labeled dataset generated in a controlled 5G lab environment. The raw packet captures (`.pcapng`) were processed through a multi-stage pipeline to generate a feature-rich `.csv` file suitable for machine learning tasks.

---

## <br>üìä Dataset Description

The final dataset is available in the `/dataset` directory as `5G_anomaly_dataset.csv`. It contains network flow records, where each row represents a unidirectional or bidirectional flow of packets between a source and a destination. Each flow is described by a set of features and is labeled as either **Benign** or **Malicious**.

| Category    | Description                                      |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| Benign      | Normal traffic simulating user activity          |
| Malicious   | Traffic from flooding, fuzzing or Dos attacks    |

## <br>üß™ Data Generation Pipeline

The dataset was created using five-step process, designed to transform raw packet captures into a machine learning‚Äìready datasets(.csv)

### **Step 1: Raw data capture**

Traffic was captured in a 5G test lab environment using tools like Wireshark. The raw output is in the `.pcapng` format, which includes the **GPRS Tunnelling Protocol (GTP)** layer that encapsulates user traffic between the gNodeB and the UPF. üëâ Here is the raw data: [Raw data](https://mmuedumy-my.sharepoint.com/my?id=%2Fpersonal%2F1211110323%5Fstudent%5Fmmu%5Fedu%5Fmy%2FDocuments%2FPCAP&viewid=e3af6dff%2D37bb%2D422e%2Da01f%2D80d90eebd189&ga=1)


### **Step 2: GTP Layer Removal with Tracewrangler**

To analyze the inner IP packets, the GTP encapsulation must be removed. We used **Tracewrangler** for this purpose. It strips the GTP headers and saves the inner packets to a new `.pcapng` file.

Open TraceWrangler ‚Üí Load your `.pcapng` file ‚Üí Apply **Remove GTP-U headers** in `Edit Files` task ‚Üí Run the task

After removing GTP:

### **Step 3: Network Flow Generation with Argus**

The decapsulated `.pcapng` file was then processed using the **Argus (Audit Record Generation and Utilization System)** tool to convert packet-level data into network flows. Argus aggregates packets into flows based on a 5-tuple (source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, and protocol).

```bash
# Convert pcapng to Argus flow data
argus -r file_name.pcapng -w file_name.argus
```

### **Step 4: Feature Extraction with Argus**

Once the `.argus` network flow file has been generated, we extract all **available flow-level features** using the Argus client tool (`ra`). These features are directly generated by Argus and represent network statistics collected per flow.

```bash
#Extract features using ra and save to CSV
ra -r file_name.argus -seq dur mean proto stos dtos sdsb ddsb sttl dttl pkts spkts dpkts bytes sbytes dbytes offset load sload dload loss sloss dloss ploss rate srate drate state swin dwin svid dvid stcpb dtcpb tcprtt synack ackdat -c, > file_name.csv
```

### **Step 5: Feature Computation and Labeling with Jupyter Notebook**

After Argus feature extraction, some advanced features are computed using **Jupyter Notebook**, as Argus cannot directly calculate all statistical or derived metrics (e.g., Hops, Mean Packets).

We use **Anaconda**, which provides Python along with data science tools such as **Jupyter Notebook**, **Pandas**, and **NumPy**.

#### üß© Install Anaconda

Download and install from the official website:

üëâ [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)

Anaconda includes:
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn**, and more

Once installed, you can launch Jupyter Notebook in Ananconda Prompt:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

#### üìò Feature Computation Process

Open the notebook at `notebook/feature_computation.ipynb` and compute additional derived features

---

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Statistical Features ‚Äî Sum, Min, Max

```python
import pandas as pd
```

```bash
df = pd.read_csv("file_name.csv")
```

```bash
#Drop row with proto = 'man', which is extracted by Argus
df = df[df['Proto'] != 'man']
```

```bash
#Sum, Min, Max value = Mean
#Insert new columns and copy the values from the existing columns
df.insert(3, "Sum", df["Mean"])
df.insert(4, "Min", df["Mean"])
df.insert(5, "Max", df["Mean"])
```

```bash
#
```

```bash
#Insert colums at the last column (default)
df["Label"] = "Malicious"
df["Attack Type"] = "SYNFlood"
df["Attack Tool"] = "Hping3"
```


#### <br>Add features: - `sHops`, `dHops`


## üìà Feature Set

The final dataset includes features generated by both **Argus** and our custom **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** scripts.  
These features collectively describe network traffic characteristics for both normal and attack flows.
